This week we start with a problem that requires a solution performing Complete Search (or Brute Force). This means that you will need to consider all possible combinations of some variables to find the solution. 

Go through the sample problem given here: https://usaco.guide/bronze/intro-complete?lang=java

We will solve the Milk Pails problem (https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=615) this week.
